To make sure the DML scripts work, please paste the 'Saved Pictures' folder into your D drive.
The path should be "â€ªD:\Saved Pictures"

If no D drive exists on your computer, update the DML scripts for Category and Product with whichever path you place
the saved pictures folder in.

For example:
INSERT INTO category (categoryID, categoryName, categoryDescription, categoryPicture) 
VALUES (1,'T-Shirts','T-Shirts great for casual wear, work, parties', (SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET (BULK N'D:Saved Pictures\T-shirt.jpg', SINGLE_BLOB)image));
 
If you paste the Saved Pictures folder into some other destination, the above query should be

INSERT INTO category (categoryID, categoryName, categoryDescription, categoryPicture) 
VALUES (1,'T-Shirts','T-Shirts great for casual wear, work, parties', (SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET (BULK N'"your saved destination:"\Saved Pictures\T-shirt.jpg', SINGLE_BLOB)image));

Thank you!
